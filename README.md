The goal is to provide a simple & comprehensive FTP Server library.

Note: this is a fork of [andrewarrow/paradise_ftp](https://github.com/andrewarrow/paradise_ftp) but many things have been changed since then.

## Current status of the project

### Features

 * Uploading and downloading files
 * Directory listing (LIST + MLST)
 * File and directory deletion and renaming
 * TLS support (AUTH + PROT)
 * File download/upload resume support (REST)
 * Complete driver for all the above features
 * Passive socket connections (EPSV and PASV commands)
 * Active socket connections (PORT command)
 * Small memory footprint
 * Only relies on the standard library except for logging which uses [go-kit log](https://github.com/go-kit/kit/tree/master/log).
 * Supported extensions:
   * [AUTH](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2228#page-6) - Control session protection
   * [PROT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2228#page-8) - Transfer protection
   * [MDTM](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#page-8) - File Modification Time
   * [SIZE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#page-11) - Size of a file
   * [REST](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#page-13) - Restart of interrupted transfer
   * [MLST](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#page-23) - Simple file listing for machine processing
   * [MLSD](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3659#page-23) - Directory listing for machine processing

## Quick test with docker

A demo server is shipped so that you can fully understand how you can use it, you can test it with the following
container (less than 15MB image, based on alpine):

```
# Creating a storage dir
mkdir data

# Starting the sample FTP server
docker run --rm -d -p 2121-2200:2121-2200 -v $(pwd)/data:/data fclairamb/ftpserver

# Connecting to it and uploading a file
ftp ftp://test:test@localhost:2121
!wget -c -O ftpserver-v0.3 https://github.com/fclairamb/ftpserver/releases/download/v0.3/ftpserver
put ftpserver-v0.3 ftpserver-v0.3
quit
ls -lh data/ftpserver-v0.3
```

## The driver

### The API
```go
// ServerDriver handles the authentication and ClientHandlingDriver selection
type ServerDriver interface {
	// Load some general settings around the server setup
	GetSettings() *Settings

	// WelcomeUser is called to send the very first welcome message
	WelcomeUser(cc ClientContext) (string, error)

	// UserLeft is called when the user disconnects, even if he never authenticated
	UserLeft(cc ClientContext)

	// AuthUser authenticates the user and selects an handling driver
	AuthUser(cc ClientContext, user, pass string) (ClientHandlingDriver, error)

	// GetCertificate returns a TLS Certificate to use
	// The certificate could frequently change if we use something like "let's encrypt"
	GetTLSConfig() (*tls.Config, error)
}

// ClientHandlingDriver handles the file system access logic
type ClientHandlingDriver interface {
	// ChangeDirectory changes the current working directory
	ChangeDirectory(cc ClientContext, directory string) error

	// MakeDirectory creates a directory
	MakeDirectory(cc ClientContext, directory string) error

	// ListFiles lists the files of a directory
	ListFiles(cc ClientContext) ([]os.FileInfo, error)

	// OpenFile opens a file in 3 possible modes: read, write, appending write (use appropriate flags)
	OpenFile(cc ClientContext, path string, flag int) (FileStream, error)

	// DeleteFile deletes a file or a directory
	DeleteFile(cc ClientContext, path string) error

	// GetFileInfo gets some info around a file or a directory
	GetFileInfo(cc ClientContext, path string) (os.FileInfo, error)

	// RenameFile renames a file or a directory
	RenameFile(cc ClientContext, from, to string) error

	// CanAllocate gives the approval to allocate some data
	CanAllocate(cc ClientContext, size int) (bool, error)
}

// ClientContext is implemented on the server side to provide some access to few data around the client
type ClientContext interface {
	// Get current path
	Path() string

	// SetDebug activates the debugging of this connection commands
	SetDebug(debug bool)

	// Debug returns the current debugging status of this connection commands
	Debug() bool
	
	// Client's ID on the server
	ID() uint32

	// Client's address
	RemoteAddr() net.Addr
}

// FileStream is a read or write closeable stream
type FileStream interface {
	io.Writer
	io.Reader
	io.Closer
	io.Seeker // <-- Will be used for "REST" command
}

// Settings define all the server settings
type Settings struct {
	ListenHost     string     // Host to receive connections on
	ListenPort     int        // Port to listen on
	PublicHost     string     // Public IP to expose (only an IP address is accepted at this stage)
	MaxConnections int        // Max number of connections to accept
	DataPortRange  *PortRange // Port Range for data connections. Random one will be used if not specified
}
```

### Sample implementation

Have a look at the [sample driver](https://github.com/fclairamb/ftpserver/tree/master/sample). It shows how you can plug your FTP server to something else, in this case your file system.

## Sample run
```
$ ftp ftp://a:a@localhost:2121

## History of the project

I wanted to make a system which would accept files through FTP and redirect them to something else. Go seemed like the obvious choice and it seemed there was a lot of libraries available but it turns out none of them were in a useable state.

* [micahhausler/go-ftp](https://github.com/micahhausler/go-ftp) is a  minimalistic implementation 
* [shenfeng/ftpd.go](https://github.com/shenfeng/ftpd.go) is very basic and 4 years old.
* [yob/graval](https://github.com/yob/graval) is 3 years old and “experimental”.
* [goftp/server](https://github.com/goftp/server) seemed OK but I couldn't use it on both Filezilla and the MacOs ftp client.
* [andrewarrow/paradise_ftp](https://github.com/andrewarrow/paradise_ftp) - Was the only one of the list I could test right away. Still, it missed few features, had some unecessary ones and I wanted to architecture it a bit differently.

That's why I forked from this last one.
